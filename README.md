To set up the project, first rename the .env.example file to .env and enter your database credentials in it. Next, go to the root directory of the project and run the command npm install to install all backend dependencies. After that, start the backend server by running npm run start.

Once the backend is running, move to the frontend folder by typing cd frontend. Inside the frontend directory, run npm install to install the required frontend dependencies. Finally, start the frontend application using the command npm start.
